# Steal the Bacon
## The NodeJS Version

Yes, we're porting over to NodeJS. It seems a little more promising, plus we get to learn something new.
Also, CoffeeScript and Jade templates are cool

### Building
- So if you want to build this to test locally, check out the Cakefile by typing `cake`
- `cake test` to test without compiling
- `cake build` to build the JS from CoffeeScript
- `cake start` to start build JS
- `cake run` to compile and build
